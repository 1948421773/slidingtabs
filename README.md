# DEPRECATED
This lib is deprecated in favor of Google's [Design Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#design) which includes a [TabLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/TabLayout.html) and is no longer being developed.

Thanks for all your support!
